The folder is for Assignment 3 of HW3 and deals with the group project centered around citibike data.

Group Members: Dara Perl, Diogo Miura, Keith Dumanski, Nate Weber and Neil D'Souza

For this group project we decided to look at the dependency on the start time of riding a bike and age group using the citibike data from January 2015. We selected millenials and non-millenials as our two age group and checked to see if the age group influenced riding a bike late at night.

Using chi square test for independence we were able to ascertain that age group does influence the tendency to ride late at night.

My contribution: Mainly, I helped the group with the statistics part of the project.
I did help a bit with the code and added the z-test to my ipython notebook just to cross check our results.

Files included: 1. The Assigment3 ipython notebook
				2. The citibike csv file that we used for the project.
