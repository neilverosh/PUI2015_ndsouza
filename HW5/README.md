This folder contains assignments for HW5

1. HW5Assignment1.ipynb looks at Energy Consumption of a building versus the total number 	 of units it has. We saw how taking log affects the plots as well as how to carry out  	   regressions using a line and a curve. We dealt with cleaning data as well as log-	   likelihood in the regression summaries.

2. HW5Assignment2.ipynb delves into the median income of women and men and aims at 		   looking at different ways to compare them, race is also taken onto consideration. 

People I discussed the assigments and code with - Diogo Miura, Maria Filippelli, Priya Khokher, Nikhil Kishore and Xia Wang.
