Plot peer review

1.![Alt text](https://github.com/myphan92/PUI2015_mphan/blob/master/HW8/graph.png)

CLARITY: In general, the plot is quite clear. The size of the values on the X-axis and Y-axis should be increased. There is also no need to keep the outliers as it compresses the plot quite a bit.

ESTHETIC: The plot looks good and is quite colorblind compliant. All aspects are well represented.

HONESTY: Age could be more clearly represented insted of using birth yearbut overall the plot explains the data very well.

SUGGESTIONS: An improvement in sizes and probably exclusion of outliers.

CLARITY: Most descriptions are small which makes it hard to interpret the purpose of the plot. The axes do not seem well defined and the title does not clarify much.

ESTHETIC: The plot is visually pleasing but not too compliant towardness color blindness.

HONESTY: The lack of clarity makes it hard to tell if the data is being well represented.

SUGGESTIONS: Increase the size of the plot for better viewing and maybe change a few clours.

3.![Alt text](https://github.com/yanchao1992/pui2015_yxu/blob/master/hw8/hw8.png)

CLARITY: The title of the graph is quite small, the relative sizes of labels seems off.

ESTHETIC: The plot is adequate but compressed.

HONESTY: The outliers do not best describe the data and should be excluded. There is age of greater than 100 which may not need to be kept (and may most likely be worng).

SUGGESTIONS: Remove outliers and maybe add some analysis to the plot.
